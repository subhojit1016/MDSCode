This project involves developing a Python-based computational framework to strategize and optimize investments in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems across two economic scenarios: standalone economy and sharing economy. The model considers operational costs, net metering policies, and the impact of natural disasters, helping to determine the optimal area of PV installation for households while maximizing profits. By analyzing different investment strategies, the project provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the PV market, enabling government and private institutions to enhance the resilience of solar energy systems and encourage sustainable energy adoption. Ultimately, this work supports informed decision-making for individuals and communities, promoting a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable future.
